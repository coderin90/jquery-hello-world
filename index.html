  <!--

  A couple of gotchas

  note how we start the `src` attribute's value with // to make

  src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"

  If you run this page locally, and you inspect the developer tools,
  you'll encounter a most unfortunate error. However, if you tweak it a
  bit to look like


  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"

  It should run normally.

  For the former to work, it has to be hosted on a server.
